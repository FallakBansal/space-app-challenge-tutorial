# Analyze Vector Data

## Background
During ingestion pipeline, we retrieved the underlying vector data from satellite images and stored them in dataframe format as parquet files. The advantage of using vector data, compared to raster data, is that dataframe is more Query/ML/AI friendly and people can easily apply their favorite AI/ML tools on the data directly.

## Demo
Follow [this code pattern](https://developer.ibm.com/patterns/analyze-satellite-data-with-watson-studio-spatiotemporal-function/) to learn how to use vector data. It covers various of common usages including: joining and aligning multiple layers, applying ML/AI on the data to retrieve insights, spatiotemporal analysis, and data visualization.

## Advanced Topic:
In the demo above, the input data is extracted from the cloud storage by leveraging IBM Cloud SQL Query. However, the volume of satellite data can be extremely large and it might take a long time to get the data you need. In the raster data query tutorial, we have seen the Cloud Optimized GeoTiff support on Cloud Object Storage which enables fast data retrival from arbitrary amount of data, you might be wondering if we have similar technology on vector data as well? The answer is yes and it is called data skipping. And we have couple detailed blog articles [here](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/accelerate-your-big-data-analytics-and-reduce-costs-by-using-ibm-cloud-sql-query) and [here](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/data-skipping-for-ibm-cloud-sql-query) on that. Data skipping provides a further big improvements on top of the common exercise of big data layout on cloud storage, including hive-style partitioning in the object key.  If you are not familiar with big data layout, it is recommended to read [this blog](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/big-data-layout) first.
