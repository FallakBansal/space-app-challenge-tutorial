# Analyze Vector Data

## Background
During ingestion pipeline, we retrieved the underlying vector data from satellite images and stored them in dataframe format as parquet files. The advantage of using vector data, compared to raster data, is that dataframe is more Query/ML/AI friendly and people can easily apply their favorite AI/ML tools on the data directly.

## Demo
Follow [this code pattern](https://developer.ibm.com/patterns/analyze-satellite-data-with-watson-studio-spatiotemporal-function/) to learn how to use vector data. It covers various of common usages including: joining and aligning multiple layers, applying ML/AI on the data to retrieve insights, spatiotemporal analysis, and data visualization.
