# Time Series Analysis on Satellite Imagery

## Background

We have seen how we could analyze single satellite image to gain insights, especially on the spatial dimension. Now with more satellite images, we can further leverage another powerful dimension of satellite data - temporal dimension. We can form a time series from a series of satellite data and perform time series analysis on it.

In this example, we demonstrate how can build time series data from satellite images and extract features from it, which can be further analyzed by other time series ML/AI models.
